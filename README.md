Time-Domain Multi-modal Bone/air Conducted Speech Enhancement

The original paper can be found in https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/yu.tsao/publications_en.html or https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9112325 for IEEE members.

In this github, we provide the proposed early/late fusion of our proposed multi-modal speech enhancement solutions. We also paked our code environment with miniconda env.yml file.

Time-Domain Multi-modal Bone/air Conducted Speech Enhancement

The original paper can be found in https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/yu.tsao/publications_en.html or https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9112325 for IEEE members.

In this github, we provide the proposed early/late fusion of our proposed multi-modal speech enhancement solutions, and the speech corpus in both ACM (air condcted microphone) and BCM (bone conducted microphone) aligned along time axis. We also paked the environment we used with miniconda envirinment.yml file.
